Now it's time to fix the style of the project. Add italic, bold, custom tags if needed, or any of the modifiers you haven't used. You might want to print the corrected version to do it again, but it's not strictly required.

1. Add citations.
2. Add italic.
3. Add bold.
4. Fix everything else you don't like.
