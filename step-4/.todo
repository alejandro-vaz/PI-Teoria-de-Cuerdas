Now join all files via ILovePDF PDF joiner. As of the release date of this update, this the only valid joiner I know because it is the one which does maintain link functionality.

1. Go to https://www.ilovepdf.com/es/unir_pdf and join everything.
2. Add extra resources to the project that might be useful, like presentations or related projects.
